# Contributing to goyave.dev

Thank you very much for your time contributing to the Goyave framework!

All pushes on `master` trigger a build and deployment of the website. Therefore, unfinished documentation and WIPs take place in branches. You can open your pull requests on the `master` branch. Although spelling is checked in CI, please double-check before opening your pull request.

This package's versioning matches the framework versioning. This website was historically living in the same repository as the framework. Using a matching versioning makes it easier to find the state of the documentation at a point in time. If the version is v3.6.0, you know it's the documentation in its state when the framework's v3.6.0 released.
